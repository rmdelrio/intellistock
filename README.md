IntelliStock - Restaurant Food Inventory and Ordering System

Project Description
IntelliStock is a comprehensive inventory and ordering system tailored for restaurants, utilizing machine learning for sales forecasting and inventory optimization. The system integrates modern technologies to manage inventory, track daily sales, and streamline ordering processes with vendors.

This project uses Python (Django) for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. The system incorporates TensorFlow for machine learning to predict inventory requirements based on historical sales data.

Features
Inventory Management: Track, update, and manage inventory items.
Order Management: Create, update, and track orders with vendors.
Machine Learning Forecasting: Predict suggested order quantities using TensorFlow.
Responsive Frontend: User-friendly UI/UX designed with React.js and Bootstrap.
Role-Based Access: Access control for admins, managers, and staff.
Data Analytics: Weekly sales projection with detailed reports.

Technologies Used
Backend:
Python: Core language for backend logic.
Django: Web framework for API development.
TensorFlow: Machine learning for forecasting inventory needs.

Frontend:
React.js: User interface development.
Bootstrap: Responsive and modern styling.
HTML5/CSS3: Structuring and styling web pages.

Database:
PostgreSQL: Reliable relational database for structured data.
